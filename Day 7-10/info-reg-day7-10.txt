I have not solved the problems for day 7 to 10 due to time constraints. 
And most probably I wont be solving it.

You can get one of day 8's question and one of day 9's question from the Assignment folder. 
And you can find few codes from Lab experiments. 
Day 7 and 8 problems is literally similar to day 4.
So refer day day 4 to solve day 7 and day 8. 
Day 9 concepts and code can be Sem Materials folder. Use it to implement it on your own.
Day 10 is based on combining all the concepts learned so far. 
I would strongly recommend solving it on your own so you can get a good understading of all concepts and codes. 
Again day 10 is really crucial. EDA is really really important as you go furthur into Data Analysis or ML. 
So make sure you are strong with your foundantions ( EDA )

THANK YOU !!
